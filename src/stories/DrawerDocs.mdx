# Drawer

Drawer is a modal that's ideal for secondary menus or long-form copy that's too large for a Popover. It's built on [Floating-UI React DOM Interactions](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react-dom-interactions).

## Controlled component

Drawer is a controlled component. Show/hide it by toggling the `isOpen` prop. When `isOpen` changes (or Drawer is closed via ESC or clicking off the Drawer's contents), `onOpenChange` is fired.

## Implementation

<ArgsTable of={Drawer} />

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Drawer from './somewhere!'

const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
const handleToggle = () => {
  setIsOpen((prevIsOpen) => !prevIsOpen);
};

***

<Drawer
  trigger={
    <button type="button">
      {isOpen ? "Close Drawer" : "Open Drawer"}
    </button>
  }
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onOpenChange={setIsOpen}
  placement="top"
>
  <div style={{ padding: "2rem" }}>
    <div>Hello, I'm Drawer's content.</div>
    <button type="button" onClick={handleToggle}>
      Close Drawer
    </button>
  </div>
</Drawer>
```

## isFullScreen, mountNodeId

By default, Drawer displays an overlay/backdrop and renders full-screen. It automatically renders in a portal at the end of the DOM.

If you want Drawer to render inside a parent element with no overlay, set `isFullScreen` to `false`, and specify the parent using `mountNodeId`.

> Be sure to set `position: relative;` on the parent, so Drawer can position itself using absolute positioning.
